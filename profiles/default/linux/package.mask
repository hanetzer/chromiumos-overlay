# The following are here because we override the ebuilds from the
# portage tree for a reason other than adding an ebuild from upstream

# version of these packages even if a newer stable version becomes
# available in portage:

# Custom patches
>sys-boot/syslinux-3.83-r2

# Custom patches

# libpng security vulnerability fix
