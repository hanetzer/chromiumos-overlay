# TODO: Fix lsof to cross compile on ARM
>sys-process/lsof-4.81-r2

# The following are here because we override the ebuilds from the
# portage tree for a reason other than adding an ebuild from upstream
# that wasn't yet in our portage tree. We want to keep using our
# version of these packages even if a newer stable version becomes
# available in portage:

# Cross compile fix in the ebuild (Icedtea -> cups -> libgcrypt).
>dev-libs/libgcrypt-1.4.6

# Masked all upstream ebuilds, unupstreamable work in local copy
>=net-misc/dhcpcd-5.1.5

# Masked all upstream ebuilds
>=net-wireless/wpa_supplicant-0.7.3

# Custom patches
>=sys-boot/syslinux-3.84

# We want to pin to the libpng version Chromium itself is using on targets.
>=media-libs/libpng-1.3

# This is unloved by mesa, and should never be pulled into the targets.
# It is actually for clang and ASAN that we want to have edge versions.
# This should be kept in sync with package.keywords.
=sys-devel/llvm-3.5_pre*

# We only support python-2.x for cross-compiling atm.
