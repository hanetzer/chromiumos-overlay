DESCRIPTION="List of packages that are needed inside the SDK, but after we've
built all the toolchain packages that we install separately via binpkgs.  This
avoids circular dependencies when bootstrapping."

# The vast majority of packages should not be listed here!  You most likely
# want to update virtual/target-chromium-os-sdk instead.  Only list packages
# here that need the cross-compiler toolchains installed first.
